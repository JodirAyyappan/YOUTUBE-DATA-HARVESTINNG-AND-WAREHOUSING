This project aims to create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The application retrieves relevant data using the YouTube API, stores it in a data lake, and provides options to store and query the data in a SQL database.  

## Technologies Used  
Python: For data retrieval, processing, and visualization.  
Streamlit: For creating the interactive user interface.  
Google API Client Library: For accessing the YouTube API.  
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.  
MySQL: For storing and querying the data.  
MySQL connector : For database interaction.
