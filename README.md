# YOUTUBE-DATA-HARVESTINNG-AND-WAREHOUSING
Data harvesting and Warehousing
This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel, stores it in a SQL database, and enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED: this project requires the following components:

STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.

PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.

GOOGLE API CLIENT: The googleapiclient library in Python facilitates the communication with different Google APIs. Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details, video specifics, and comments. By utilizing googleapiclient, developers can easily access and manipulate YouTube's extensive data resources through code.

MySQL: MySQL is an open-source, advanced, and highly scalable database management system (DBMS) known for its reliability and extensive features. It provides a platform for storing and managing structured data, offering support for various data types and advanced SQL capabilities.
